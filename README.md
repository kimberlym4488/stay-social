## Project Description

This api uses Mongo and Mongoose to implement full social network capability in a lightweight package!

## Installation

Open in node js, run an npm install. Open insomnia to view full CRUD capability.

## Usage

Combined with a front end/client side routes, controller, and views this would make a social network functional and extremely efficient.

## Test Instructions

Pull down the project from github and test in insomnia. Seed files are not required if you run post routes first.
